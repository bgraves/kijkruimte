Kijkruimte is the iOS platform for HearUsHear [http://hearushere.nl/](http://hearushere.nl/)
========================================================================================

HearUsHere is an augmented audio app. While walking towards and away from geo-located sounds you are composing a unique audio tour via volume control and constructing your own audio environment entangled with physical reality.

The platform is build on top the [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) API, where the sounds are hosted and tagged.  The platform is built to be friendly to data roamers, and the content is downloaded and cached on app launch.  The user experience is intentionally simple, as the creators of the app desired to get the phone out of one's face and into their pocket to ensure a true awareness of the physical surroundings.

An implementation of HearUsHere is available in the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearushere/id579920959?mt=8) as a tour of the Van der Pekbuurt with stories by artists and neighbors from the KijkRuimte archives. The stories are about how a social housing district needs to make way for renewal and about the impact of the restructuring process on daily life in the neighborhood.
